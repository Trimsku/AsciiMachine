# Hello! This is AsciiMachine!
The engine for create ascii games
AsciiMachine tested on Linux.

Project has got small std alternatives and wrappers, i.e: 
2. astd::container, (std::vector alternative).
3. astd::Clock, getEllapsedTime(), and restart().

For building example:
  1. Install spm(this is my project).
  2. in project root dir: ./<path/to/spm
  3. make
  4. ./bin/Release/AsciiGame
